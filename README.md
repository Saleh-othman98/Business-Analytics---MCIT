## Project 1: Working with data

   ### Project description
   
A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, we’ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.

 ## Project 4: Build a Data Visualization project
 
   ### Project Introduction
In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to combine a lot of what you’ve learned throughout this entire program. This project may seem challenging and there isn’t a lot of guidance provided, as we want you to have the freedom to be creative. That dataset that you are working with is real and it is pretty big. When you are analyst for a company, there often isn’t guidance as to how to correctly answer a particular question. And there might not really be one right answer. Leverage your own skills. Make sure you look through the directions carefully.
